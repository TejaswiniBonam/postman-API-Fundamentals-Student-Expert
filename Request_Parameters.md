# Request Parameters
* Postman allows you to save values as variables to reuse them and easily hide sensitive information like API Keys
* We will use a variable to replace our base URL so that we don't have to type that repeatedly. Once a variable is defined, you can access its value using double curly brace syntax like this: **{{variableName}}**

### Let's set a variable
* Let's make a variable for the host that we used in the previous request.
* select the url and right click, you'll see "Set as a variable"
* CLick that and give it a name
* **Variable Names are cAsE Sensitive**
* And then Define it's scope like Global, Collection, Vault..
* And DONE
* From then it'll be represented as {{name_of_variable}}

## Where to see the Variables???
* Click on your collection name and you can get to see the variable tab
* Seems like you can even modify the variable as there are two columns called "Initial Value" and "Current Value".
