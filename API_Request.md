## Create a Collection
### wait- what is a collection??
* Collections are places to organize your API requests in Postman.
* They serve as executable documentation of API endpoints.
  * **WHAT IS AN API ENDPOINT?** - An API endpoint is a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) where an API (Application Programming Interface) can be accessed to perform a particular function or retrieve specific data.
* A Collection in Postman is a group of HTTP requests that can be organized, saved, and executed together.
* It helps developers group related API endpoints for better organization and testing.


### steps to create a collection
* In ur respective workspace, Click "NEW" or "+".
* Click Blank collection and Name it.. that's It.
