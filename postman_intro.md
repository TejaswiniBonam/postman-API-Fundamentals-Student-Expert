# POSTMAN
## An API Platform
* Postman is an API testing tool that helps developers interact with APIs easily without writing code.
* Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs.
* Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs faster and consume them with ease.

## Working with APIs then and now: 
## cURL vs. Postman
* Before Postman, it was common practice to poke at APIs with a command line tool for making HTTP requests called cURL.
* This tool is still used today but has its limitations when it comes to collaboration and sharing.

## API calls with curl
* this is an example of what an API call in the terminal using the curl command looks like. Here we are fetching data about GitHub user postmanlabs
* It works great, but once you make the call, the API response data is lost in the river of the terminal.
* You also don't have visibility of the metadata of the response without adding more details to the command.
```bash
curl https://api.github.com/users/postmanlabs
```

# API calls with Postman
* Here is the same call done with Postman.
* Postman shows the response with clean indents and colors and allows you to save, organize and share your requests.
* You can also see all the components of the request and response broken down into tabs and other helpful details like the response time and status code.
