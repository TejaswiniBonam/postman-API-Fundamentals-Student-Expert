# POSTMAN
## An API Platform
* Postman is an API testing tool that helps developers interact with APIs easily without writing code.
* Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs.
* Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs faster and consume them with ease.

## Working with APIs then and now: 
## cURL vs. Postman
* Before Postman, it was common practice to poke at APIs with a command line tool for making HTTP requests called cURL.
* This tool is still used today but has its limitations when it comes to collaboration and sharing.

## API calls with curl
* this is an example of what an API call in the terminal using the curl command looks like. Here we are fetching data about GitHub user postmanlabs
```bash
curl https://api.github.com/users/postmanlabs
```
