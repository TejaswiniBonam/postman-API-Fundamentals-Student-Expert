# Postman API Fundamentals Student Expert certification

## API Application Programming Interfaces
* An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
* an API acts as a bridge between two applications
* they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.
* Example : Twilio API, It helps us send messages through whatsapp.

### Why use API?
* APIs simplify complex processes. Instead of building everything from scratch, developers can use existing APIs to add functionality to their applications.
  * ex: using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons
* APIs allow different software systems to work together.
  * For example, a weather app can use an API to get weather data from a weather service.
* By using APIs, developers can save time and resources, focusing on building their application rather than reinventing the wheel.
* Reusing functionalities.
* APIs can be products themselves
  * ex: Software as a Service (SaaS) products like Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs

### Who works with APIs?
*APIs are not just for developers. According to Postman's latest State of the API Report, almost half of the survey respondents identified as holding non-developer roles, such as management, solutions architects, business and data analysts, educators and researchers. All these roles benefit from the standardized data access provided by APIs*.

### APIs - A Digital Restaurant

* You can think of APIs as being like a waiter at a restaurant, serving as a go-between for the customer and the kitchen.

* A customer who wants soup **doesn't go** into the kitchen to cook. They don't even have to know **how to make soup!** They only have to know how to ask the waiter for soup, expecting the ***waiter*** to bring back soup.
* APIs work the same way, but there are different names for the players involved. Instead of soup, the *requester* might ask for data or execution of a service.

| Networking Term | Description | Restaurant Analogy |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Client | The requester. Ex: browser, web app, mobile app | Customer | 
| API | Simplified interface for interacting with the backend | Waiter | 
| Server | The backend where the processing happens | Kitchen |

### Types of APIs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Hardware APIs 
*Hardware APIs allow software applications to communicate with hardware components like cameras, microphones, sensors, or GPUs without the developer having to deal with the internal complexity of the hardware.*
* **How They Work** : When a developer writes code to access hardware features, they don't write code that directly controls the hardware.
 * Instead, they use APIs provided by the operating system.
 * The operating system acts as a middle layer between the software and hardware.
* **Example ðŸ“±** : Imagine you're building a mobile app that needs to take pictures.
 * If the code includes the below code, the **Camera** is the API, your code calls this API.
 * OS receives that request and communicates with the Camera Hardware driver.
 * And the same Camera API gives you the captured image as a response
```python
#code calls Camera API open() method
#OS receives request and communicate with the real Camera H/W and opens the camera as response
Camera.open();

#code calls API captureimage()
#OS talks with real cam
#captures image
Camera.captureImage();
```
**Examples**

| Hardware	API | Example |	Platform |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Camera |	CameraX |	Android |
| Microphone |	MediaRecorder |	Android |
| GPS |	LocationManager |	Android |
| Bluetooth |	CoreBluetooth |	iOS |
| Graphics Card (GPU)	| DirectX	| Windows |
