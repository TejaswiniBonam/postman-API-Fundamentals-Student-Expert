# Postman API Fundamentals Student Expert certification

## API Application Programming Interfaces
* An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
* an API acts as a bridge between two applications
* they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.
* Example : Twilio API, It helps us send messages through whatsapp.

### Why use API?
* APIs simplify complex processes. Instead of building everything from scratch, developers can use existing APIs to add functionality to their applications.
  * ex: using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons
* APIs allow different software systems to work together.
  * For example, a weather app can use an API to get weather data from a weather service.
* By using APIs, developers can save time and resources, focusing on building their application rather than reinventing the wheel.
* Reusing functionalities.
* APIs can be products themselves
  * ex: Software as a Service (SaaS) products like Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs

### Who works with APIs?
*APIs are not just for developers. According to Postman's latest State of the API Report, almost half of the survey respondents identified as holding non-developer roles, such as management, solutions architects, business and data analysts, educators and researchers. All these roles benefit from the standardized data access provided by APIs*.

### APIs - A Digital Restaurant

You can think of APIs as being like a waiter at a restaurant, serving as a go-between for the customer and the kitchen.
